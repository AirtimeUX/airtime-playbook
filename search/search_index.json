Yet the most common objection we hear is \"Ain't nobody got time for that\" . People are busy shipping features, putting out fires, and dealing with their daily jobs. To some extent, this is normal. Every organization has conflicting priorities and there are always short-term problems to solve, but if the product team doesn't understand users, it leads to a deadly spiral of more short-term problems and failed products. It's an ever-present challenge for user researchers to make sure that participating in research gets the priority it deserves. We have gathered some best practices to help. Make it easy Treat your research as your product and your stakeholders like your customers. If a product is difficult to buy, people don't buy it. The easier you make it to participate in your research, the less resistance you will see from the product team, or even other stakeholders, like leadership. Setting up an Internal Research Calendar and proactively notifying stakeholders about opportunities to join research is a good way to start. Make it engaging Ever heard the phrase, \"Research reports are where insights go to die?\" The sad reality is that static presentations of research results are boring and don't engage stakeholders. In our UX consulting projects we have seen many companies put tremendous effort into creating well-structured presentations, insight repositories, and short video supercuts of user interviews. While these assets have their place in user research, despite the gargantuan editorial work that goes into creating them, they fail to make an impact as barely anyone reads them. They are not enough on their own. Humans are excited by interactions with other humans and deep insights are developed through active engagement and not passive consumption. User research should be fun for everyone and not the bitter prescribed medicine. We recommend giving participants 5-15 minutes of airtime in each user session to ask their questions and validate their own assumptions. This also improves the research results, as everybody can bring their own expertise and viewpoints to the table and uncover additional insights. Additionally, make sure that you brief participants and allocate tasks to them before the interview, such as noting down their 5 most important learnings, to make sure they are actively engaged. But all that bias! It is a valid concern, that if somebody participates in one or two sessions, they can walk away with biased, skewed, and statistically insignificant conclusions of user needs. The good news is that once somebody engaged with users, they will have developed a genuine curiosity for the big picture. Make sure to organize a recap or synthesis session at the end of a research project where all stakeholders can participate and hone their insights. Make time Organizations often allocate time and effort to important tasks that otherwise may get overlooked by setting very simple goals. \"Every engineering team should spend 30% of their story points on technical debt tickets to ensure long-term code quality and maintainability\" \"The last week of every quarter, product teams should work on whatever feature they are passionate about to foster innovation (aka. hack week)\" These types of goals are simple, easy to understand, and easy to commit to. They build culture, and leadership loves them. We recommend having a similar goal for research participation. 2 hours every six weeks is a good number, but you might want to start smaller to ease adoption. Setting the goal is the important part. It also makes sense to think about different types of stakeholders and target a different number for each type. Designers arguably benefit more from spending time in research than executives or devops engineers. Make the benefits visible It is common wisdom that customer-centric companies investing in user research build better products and become more successful. But user research struggles with the problem that the rewards of this investment are realized with a great delay, and therefore its value often gets overlooked. Between uncovering a golden customer insight and designing, developing, and deploying a feature based on it, months, or in some cases, years can pass. This makes it basically impossible to accurately model and attribute the resulting increase in customer satisfaction and monetary benefits to user research. This is why it's important for researchers to implement leading indicators to measure the value of research. So important, that we have dedicated an entire section to doing this with Impact Surveys . Such indicators provide an easy-to-understand KPI for research participation. We recommend proactively publishing them at recurring KPI meetings or town halls. Pitch, sell, evangelize \"Out of sight, out of mind\" - goes the proverbial wisdom of sales. In a world of competing priorities, you have to proactively work on getting the share of the spotlight for user research that it deserves. This is especially true in the beginning when the goal is to get an initial foothold and establish the culture of research participation in an organization. Here are a few things you can do: Create a task list and allocate dedicated time in your schedule to evangelize research participation. Talk to people and find your champions in the organization. Set up a guild and work together. You will be surprised how many people will get behind your cause from all parts of the organization. Get time on the agenda in town halls, internal presentations, and other large meetings. The bigger the better. Always proactively publish opportunities to join research. Start small: a template for a pilot Trying to implement big changes all at once hardly ever succeeds. We recommend starting small with research participation, in the form of a pilot project. Select your next research project where you will talk to customers. Identify the product team (or teams) that the project is relevant to. Ideally, you should start with a team working on more customer-facing features, as they have a naturally higher interest in engaging with customers Brief the leads and the teams about what to expect and get their buy-in. The goal should be to get everyone to participate in 2 sessions. Run an initial survey before the project start to gauge their current level of understanding the user needs and other key metrics (more on this under Understanding research ROI ) Set up an internal research calendar and share it with the team As you organize your sessions, keep the team posted about interview timeslots they can sign up to. Brief stakeholders before the interviews Make sure they prepare with questions Make sure they note down key insights during the interview Run the user sessions with the stakeholders participating Synthesize and analyze project findings as you would normally Organize a final session with all stakeholders present to share and discuss insights Run an Impact Survey after the project is concluded and measure the improvement on key KPIs.

Setting up Google Calendar Step1: Create a new shared calendar in Google Calendar by clicking the plus sign next to Other Calendars . If this option is not available to you, ask your IT admin to create a new calendar and give you permissions to 'Make changes and manage sharing'. Step 2: Give your calendar a name and description and set the Auto-accept invitations setting to Auto-accept invitations that do not conflict . This will simplify adding events to the calendar. Step 3: Set sharing settings for the calendar. Select Make available for {Your organization} under Access permissions for events and select See all event details . Alternatively, if you want to share the calendar outside of your organization, you can select Make available to public , however in this case the calendar will be discoverable and accessible by anyone, which might not be something you want. Add any other researchers from your team under Share with specific people to give them access to Manage changes and manage sharing . Step 4: Share the calendar. Click the Get shareable link button under Access permissions for events . The link will add the calendar for any stakeholder that clicks it. Share it in slack, email, and any other communication channel you have. This is a good opportunity to promote your research and get people interested in participating. Using Google Calendar Approach 1: Using the same event To make a research session available in your internal research calendar, invite it to the event, as you would any regular participant. Make sure you untick See guest list under Guest permissions so the participant's email address does not show up in the research calendar. The advantage of this approach is that if a participant cancels or reschedules, it will automatically be reflected in your research calendar. The drawback is that there is no way to change the event details in the research calendar, which is not ideal if you want to include internal information or links in the meeting description. Approach 2: Copying the event You can also copy the event to your internal research calendar. This allows you to change the details, but if any changes are made to the original event, you will have to update the event in the research calendar manually. Adding stakeholders to events The internal research calendar is a good way to keep stakeholders informed about research opportunities, but inviting stakeholders to sessions is still somewhat of a manual process. We recommend that you post regular updates in slack if new research opportunities come in. Step 1: Make a post in a relevant slack channel, asking stakeholders to indicate which timeslot they are interested in in a thread. Step 2: Invite interested stakeholders to the appropriate event as you would to a normal calendar event. The advantage of this process is that you can keep control over who is invited to which session and make sure that sessions don't get overcrowded.","title":"Setting up a stakeholder calendar"},{"location":"collaborative_calendar/#setting-up-a-stakeholder-calendar","text":"An internal research calendar can be a useful tool to keep participation opportunities on the radar of stakeholders and simplify administration.","title":"Setting up a stakeholder calendar"},{"location":"collaborative_calendar/#setting-up-google-calendar","text":"Step1: Create a new shared calendar in Google Calendar by clicking the plus sign next to Other Calendars .

Keep in mind, that observers aren\u2019t always familiar with the format and don\u2019t know what to look out for. Give them guidelines beforehand so they can come back with more useful observations A good starting point for such guidelines: Don't transcribe everything that's said during the interview, it takes away focus from observing and multiple people don't need to do that. Look for memorable quotes, key statements, and observations that you find related to the goal of the study, or simply find interesting. Immerse yourself and experience what the user is experiencing. Don't tune out by doing something else on your laptop. Always note down what actually happened and where Note down the exact words the user said, or as close as possible The most important thing to look out for is emotion , take notes on body language and facial expressions Don\u2019t interpret what you think is happening or tell stories \u2014 just write down what actually happened Don\u2019t come up with solutions right now Make sure that you do your note taking in a shared document, in a format that fits how you want to process the notes. Here is a Miro template to get started. Assign a sticky note color to each observer, where they will take their notes. Debriefing Always book time straight after the interview to discuss the notes and observations with the observer team. Observations are forgotten and distorted quickly, so right after the interview with fresh memories is the only chance to do this effectively. You can use the same Miro template that you used for note taking. Leave a couple of minutes in the beginning for observers to clean up and structure their notes, then do a basic Affinity Mapping exercise, simply grouping related stickies, discussing them, and drawing insights from groups of related notes.

Letting stakeholders join the same session you're in with the user We strongly recommend this approach unless you have a good reason not to do it. Being involved in the session directly gives stakeholders a better opportunity to engage, ask questions and develop empathy. Make sure you brief stakeholders beforehand so they understand the goals, the agenda, and the points you want to discuss with the user. You should still lead the majority of the session, but leave time for them to ask their questions. The caveat of this approach is that it only works with one or two stakeholders. Having any more join a session can make the whole experience awkward and disturbing for your interviewee and skew results. Make sure to keep the number of stakeholders in interviews low and let the interviewee(s) know beforehand that they will be joining, and what to expect. Streaming the session internally You have developed a great collaborative research culture and several stakeholders are eager to join every session you have. Awesome! At this point demand outweighs supply and you can't fit everyone in user sessions directly. You should start thinking about streaming sessions. This lets you talk to the user directly and stakeholders watch through a virtual observation room setup. This approach can be great for giving multiple stakeholders the opportunity to join, but due to its more passive nature, it's less engaging. There is a real risk of stakeholders tuning out during the session and not getting any benefits. To avoid this, make sure you've set collaborative note taking tasks for them and give them an opportunity to ask questions and interact with the session through slack or other communication methods built-in to your streaming tool.

It is a research process that's accessible and understandable to everyone on the team and generates insights in fast loops, as they are needed to answer research questions. Continuous research makes customer research a part of every product release, instead of an occasional large project. While any user research method can be done as part of continuous research, customer interviews are both easy to implement and yield good results in most scenarios. Customer interviews are flexible, which makes it easy to include the latest research questions by the team and receive in-depth answers and insights. Customer interviews also make it easy and fun for the team to participate. Continuous research relies heavily on automation. Te set up a continuous research pipeline, plan and execute the following steps: 1. Define customer touchpoints and opportunities to engage Brainstorm all stakeholders that have customer touchpoints in marketing, sales, customer service, and product. Decide when and how to engage with customers on a recurring basis. Event-based Customer onboarding (both successful & abandoned) Usage of a specific feature Customer lifecycle events Exit interviews Scheduled Periodic research - e.g. weekly customer council meetings. Segment-based (regular samples across personas) 2. Define triggers and actions Define exact triggers that lead to a customer being invited to an interview and define how that invitation will happen. Examples: Trigger Action Customer cancels their account Customer is redirected to a booking page, asking to participate in an interview Customer leaves the results page for free-text search without taking any action. Display a popup, asking the customer to participate in an interview. Sales meets an enterprise customer, that wants to talk to Product. Sales shares booking link. Customer completes a screener survey and meets specific demographic criteria. Send out an invitation to participate in weekly customer council meetings. You may want to repeat steps 3 & 4 for different triggers in case you want to offer a different schedule for them or involve different stakeholders. 3. Define internal stakeholders for collaborative research Which teammate can you invite to share in the learning during your interviews? Who is the core team who should always participate (tech lead, pm, etc.), and who are optional participants? (engineers, QA, etc.) What activities will stakeholders be involved in to make sure they are engaged? (observation, note taking, etc.) 4. Set up a booking link for participants Define your schedule: What hours during the week can you save for interviews? Write a short intro for your booking link describing the purpose of the meeting. Decide rewards and incentives (monetary or non-monetary) Follow the guide in Using an appointment scheduling tool to set up your booking link. Use our template in Miro to plan out the above steps.

There are a number of ways to effectively achieve this. These approaches focus on recruiting participants from within your own customer base. This usually yields better quality participants, however, in some cases, such as expanding to new markets, it may be a good option to recruit from a third-party panel. Email The most basic way of recruiting participants is sending them an email asking them to participate in research. You can embed your appointment link in these emails to let the user immediately book a session with you. CRM and Email marketing tools are especially helpful for sending out mass emails. Salesforce Mailchimp Embedding in your website Calendly lets you add its booking flow directly to your website, so your users can schedule a session with you conveniently, without leaving your site. You will have to involve the dev team to do this, but it requires minimal development work and can be accomplished quickly. Follow this tutorial for details. Using an in-app interrupt Several tools offer the possibility to display popups within your application when the user executes a specific action. These are primarily sales and marketing tools, but they can be repurposed for user research. The advantage of this approach is that you can target users based on their actions and usage patterns, giving you very relevant participants for specific research. You can embed your appointment link in these popups to make it easy for participants to immediately book a session with you. These tools usually require little to no coding, but some thought to set up.

On the one hand, good UX has a positive impact on several key business metrics: Acquisition : Understanding your users through research will help you craft messages that convert visitors into first-time users. Activation is the metric that shows users' engagement with your service. Better user experience results in more engaged users. Retention : Understanding and addressing the needs of your users leads to satisfied customers that stay with you. Referral : Delighted customers promote your product through word of mouth, which is the most cost-effective marketing you can do. Revenue : All the above results in less cost of acquiring users, and more revenue from loyal, long-term customers. On the other hand, user research ultimately also saves costs: Lower R&D costs : Better understanding of users and actively testing early prototypes minimizes the number of features that have to be redesigned or discarded. Lower Customer Support costs : Good products require less support. Lower Sales costs : As stated above, referral and word-of-mouth are the best and cheapest ways to acquire new customers. All of that starts with developing UX maturity and customer-centricity within your organization. And the best way to do that is direct customer exposure. Measuring the time you spend with users You can't manage what you don't measure as they say. The first step is to get a clear picture of how much time the organization and individual roles within the organization spend with users. To achieve this, keep track of: The total number of research projects and user sessions you have done All stakeholders that have joined user sessions The barebones way of achieving this is manually maintaining an excel or Airtable-based database of user sessions and participants. You can use this Airtable template to get started. Ultimately, you can automate this process by using a centralized tool with reporting features to schedule your user sessions. Some companies even set user exposure targets for different roles. This may or may not be suitable for you depending on your organizational culture. Recommended user exposure goals. Source: Nielsen Norman Group Tracking the impact of customer exposure There are several ways to model the UX maturity of an organization. All of them share something in common: In mature organizations, every employee has empathy with the customers, understands their pains and needs, and incorporates them into their daily work. Yet very few organizations have an understanding of where they stand and how their investment in user research moves them towards this goal. Organizations already implement ways to measure and visualize how their teams are doing in various areas. These types of models intend to get a sense of where to focus improvement efforts, and help teams become more self-aware so they can focus their improvement efforts too. Some popular examples of such models are: Spotify's Squad Health Check Model Employee Engagement Surveys Our Impact Survey is a proposal for implementing such a model for customer exposure and user research maturity.","title":"Understanding research ROI"},{"location":"impact_roi/#understanding-research-roi","text":"A mature, user-centric organization can see several benefits from investing in user research.

Be a leading indicator of key business metrics Impact Surveys are sent out periodically to teams and include questions in areas that are expected to be impacted by participating in research. They are a self-evaluation tool and the primary audience is the team itself. Instead of a static collection of survey responses, it's important to discuss the results with the team and collaboratively discover ways to improve. Impact Surveys are not a replacement for other design metrics, but a useful human-centric addition. It is still a good idea to track qualitative design metrics, such as CSAT, and include targets for them in your development projects. Question types Questions in an Impact survey should be a composition of rating scales and free-text answers. Rating scales allow you to quantify answers and track changes over time, while free-text answers let you discover root causes and come up with actions. Likert scales combined with free-text fields asking to elaborate on the rating are a good start. Similar questions are used in many standard UX surveys, such as SUS (System Usability Scale). Coming up with questions Questions in an Impact Survey should measure areas that you expect to be positively impacted by customer exposure. You can use the below formula to define them. Impact : Start with defining an impact customer exposure will have on the team. Benefit : Define why that impact matters. Business Metric : Remember that impact survey questions are leading indicators that are meant to forecast future improvements in other business metrics. This is where you define that metric. You can't and don't have to model the exact mathematical relationship, just thinking it through helps with formulating better questions Survey Statement : This is your final statement that you will include in the survey that the team has to agree/disagree with. Example questions Impact : Customer exposure will increase the team's empathy with users. Benefit : The team will build products and features that customers will be happy with. Business metric : CSAT / NPS. Survey statement : I have a thorough understanding of user needs. Impact : Customer exposure will increase the team's motivation. Benefit : The team will find their work more meaningful and feel happier in their jobs. Business metric : Employee retention. Survey statement : I feel motivated by engaging with users. Motivation is an often-overlooked benefit of customer exposure. Seeing the products and features they have worked on in action and helping other people is one of the best ways to make people feel their work is meaningful.
