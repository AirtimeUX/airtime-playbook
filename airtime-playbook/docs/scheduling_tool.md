# Using an appointment scheduling tool

To make the scheduling of user sessions easy, we recommend using an online appointment scheduling service.
These tools can save you a lot of time by providing end users with a simple calendar interface where they can sign ip to a timeslot when you're available. They can also automatically handle if a participant needs to reschedule or cancel, saving you a lot of email ping-pong.

The most popular tool in this space is [Calendly](https://calendly.com/). The free version is enough for executing a single research project, for long-term use a paid version is necessary.

There are a number of alternative scheduling tools with different features and pricing schemes available:

 - [Cal.com](https://cal.com/) is an open-source solution that you can run in a self-hosted configuration.
 - [CalendarHero](https://calendarhero.com/)
 - [Doodle](https://doodle.com/)
 - [Simplybook.me](https://simplybook.me/en/)
 
 We will use Calendly in our examples, but you can configure most of the other solutions to achieve the same goal.

> **TIP**: The free version of Calendly allows a single event type, which should be sufficient for executing your first research project.


## Using Invitee Questions to segment participants

Calendly has a useful feature that lets you collect information from participants when they sign up to a session. This is a good opportunity to gather some demographic and segmentation data that's relevant for your research project.
