# Understanding reserch ROI

A mature, user-centric organization can see several benefits from investing in user research.
On the one-hand, good UX has a positive impact on several key business metrics:

 - **Acquisition**: Understanding your users through research will help you craft messages that convert visitors into first-time users.
 - **Activation** is the metric that shows users' engagement with your service. Better user experience results in more engaged users.
 - **Retention**: Understanding and addressing the needs of your users leads to satisfied customers that stay with you.
 - **Referral**: Delighted customers promote your product through word of mouth, which is the most cost-effective marketing you can do.
 - **Revenue**: All the above result in less cost of acquiring users, and more revenue from loyal, long-term customers.
 
On the other hand, user research ultimately also saves costs:

- **Lower R&D costs**: Better understanding of users and actively testing early prototypes minimizes the number of features that have to be redesigned or discarded.
- **Lower Customer Support costs**: Good products require less support.
- **Lower Sales costs**: As stated above, referral and word-of-mouth are the best and cheapest way to acquire new customers.

All of that starts with developing UX maturity and customer centricity within your organization. And the best way to do that is direct customer exposure.

## Tracking the impact of customer exposure

[There are several ways](https://nataliehanson.com/2017/02/13/ux-maturity-models/){target=_blank} to model the UX maturity of an organization. All of them share something in common: In mature organizations every employee has empathy with the customers, understands their pains and needs and incorporates them in their daily work. Yet very few organizations have an understanding on where they stand and how their investment in user research moves them towards this goal.

Organizations already implement ways to measure and visualize how their teams are doing in various areas. The intent of these types of models is to get a sense of where to should focus improvement efforts, and help teams become more self-aware so they can focus their improvement efforts too.
Some popular examples of such models are:

- [Spotify's Squad Health Check Model](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2014/09/16/squad-health-check-model/){target=_blank}
- [Employee Engagement Surveys](https://www.cultureamp.com/blog/employee-engagement-survey-questions){target=_blank}

Our [Impact Survey](/impact_survey) is a proposal for implementing such a model for customer exposure and user research maturity.
