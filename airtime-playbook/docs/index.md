# Welcome to the Collaborative User Research Playbook

Every product company wants to build better products faster. Modern product teams are already good at **building** and releasing products quickly and iteratively but tend to lag behind, when it comes to **learning** about their users at the same speed. 

This guide contains a practical set of processes and techniques that you can implement to create a fast and lightweight user research practice that makes an impact within your organization.

Fast research has 3 pillars:

1. Make user research **continuous** by automating your recruitment pipeline and other administrative tasks.
2. Make user research **collaborative** by involving stakeholders in research and directly exposing them to users, so you develop better insights and make them stick.
3. **Measure the impact** of collaborative research, so you can monitor and manage the development of your organization's UX Maturity.
